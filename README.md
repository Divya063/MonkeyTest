# MonkeyTest

MonkeyTest -- test your hard drive write speed in Python

A simplistic script to show that such system programming
tasks are possible and convenient to be solved in Python

I haven't done any command-line arguments parsing, so
you should configure it using the constants below.

The file is being created, then written and deleted, so
the script doesn't waste your drive

(!) Be sure, that the file you point to is not smthng
    you need, cause it'll be overwritten during test

Runs on both Python3 and 2, despite that I prefer 3
Has been tested on 3.5 and 2.7 under ArchLinux
